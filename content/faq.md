## General

### What is Chuk Chat?

Chuk Chat is a privacy-focused AI chat application that uses only open-weight AI models. Your conversations are encrypted end-to-end, and we don't track or profile you.

### What are open-weight models?

Open-weight models are AI models whose weights (the parameters that define the model) are publicly available. This means anyone can inspect, audit, and verify how the model works. Examples include Llama, Mistral, and Qwen.

### Why only open-weight models?

We believe in transparency. Closed models like GPT-4 or Claude are black boxes - you don't know exactly what happens with your data. With open-weight models, the AI is auditable and trustworthy.

## Privacy & Security

### Is my data really private?

Yes. Your chat messages are encrypted on your device using AES-256-GCM before being stored. We cannot read your messages - only you have the key.

### What data do you store?

- **Encrypted:** All your chat messages and conversations
- **Not encrypted:** Email address and username (needed for authentication)
- **Usage data:** Token counts for billing (not message content)

### Do you sell my data?

No. We never sell your data to third parties.

## Subscription & Billing

### How much does it cost?

€20 per month, including 19% VAT. This includes €16 in AI credits.

### How do AI credits work?

Different AI models cost different amounts per token. Your €16 monthly credits are used as you chat. Most users find this more than enough for regular use.

### Can I cancel anytime?

Yes. You can cancel your subscription at any time in the app settings or by contacting support. Your access continues until the end of the billing period.

### What payment methods do you accept?

We use Stripe for payments, which supports credit cards, debit cards, and various local payment methods.

## Technical

### Which platforms are supported?

Chuk Chat will be available on Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, and Android. All platforms are currently in development.

### Do my chats sync across devices?

Yes. Your encrypted chats sync securely across all your devices using the same account.

### What happens if I forget my password?

Since your chats are encrypted with a key derived from your password, we cannot recover them if you forget your password. Make sure to keep your password safe.
